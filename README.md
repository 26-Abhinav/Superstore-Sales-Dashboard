# 🛒 Superstore Sales Dashboard (Power BI)
This repository contains the source file (Superstore sales dashboard.pbix) for a detailed and interactive dashboard built in Power BI, focused on analyzing Superstore Sales performance. This tool is designed to provide actionable insights into sales trends, profitability, and operational efficiency across different dimensions of the business.

# Dashboard Overview
. The dashboard likely provides a single-page (or multi-page) view that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) related    to sales, profit, and customer/product segments. 
. It utilizes a robust data model to support interactive filtering and drilling down into detailed sales performance metrics. . The visual design is influenced by a custom theme (CY25SU10.json), ensuring a professional and consistent aesthetic. 
. A unique background resource (rm218-bb-0720700459093317225.jpg) suggests the dashboard has a tailored visual layout.

# Key Components and Features
. Core Data Model (DataModel): Contains the underlying structure for sales data, including tables for orders, products,         customers, and locations. 
. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): The dashboard is expected to prominently display and analyze critical metrics, such as:    * Total Sales and Revenue. 
  * Overall Profitability (Profit and Profit Ratio).
  * Sales and Profit by geographic regions (e.g., State, City, or Country).
  * Performance across different product categories and sub-categories.
  * Sales segmented by customer dimensions (e.g., Customer Segment).
. Visual Layout and Interaction (Report/Layout): The report structure indicates a focus on visual storytelling, likely incorporating charts, maps, and slicers to allow users to quickly filter and analyze performance by:
  * Time (e.g., Year, Quarter, Month).
  * Geographic location.
  * Product or Customer attributes.
. Design and Style: A specific theme file (CY25SU10.json ) is included, which defines the color palette, fonts, and visual settings for the dashboard's design.
